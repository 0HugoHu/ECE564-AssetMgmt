## 1. Introduction

### Overview

The Duke Asset Management iOS Mobile App serves as a mobile gateway to MediaBeacon, Duke's extensive digital asset management system. This application enables users to seamlessly view, download, and upload files while ensuring that all modifications are synchronized with the MediaBeacon web server. Designed for convenience and efficiency, this mobile interface is a significant step forward in digital asset management.

### Problems

MediaBeacon, as the cornerstone of Duke's digital storage, houses over 4 million digital assets, including images, PDFs, videos, and more. Despite its vast capacity and robust web server, MediaBeacon's lack of a mobile application has been a notable shortfall. Users at Duke have frequently reported that this gap in mobile accessibility significantly hampers their work efficiency. The absence of a mobile interface limits the usability and accessibility of the system, particularly for users who rely on mobile devices for their work.

### Solution Impacts
In response to these issues, we have developed a tailored iOS app for MediaBeacon. This solution brings two major impacts:

1. **Economic Saving**: By integrating with the existing MediaBeacon system, our app negates the need for additional software subscriptions. This approach results in substantial cost savings for Duke, optimizing their budget allocation.

2. **Workflow Improvement**: The app is designed to streamline the workflow process. By providing mobile access to MediaBeacon's vast repository, it enhances user productivity and accessibility. This improvement in workflow not only makes the process more efficient but also more adaptable to the modern needs of mobile-centric users.
